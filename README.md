# AD - SBA - HTML/CSS/JavaScript



### Description
Created a 4 page website with US President's quotes and their displayed pictures. Contact/Feedback form is also created for user input and experience.

Used HTML, CSS and javascript with arrays to save the quotes and images and displayed them randomly on click of a button.

There are links to navigate between pages.

The forms can be filled in but there is an error on submission. Have to figure out how to save the form or send it via email.
